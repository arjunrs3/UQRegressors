A brief introduction is given here to standard Gaussian process regression, with a full treatment in (Rasmussen). Gaussian processes model a distribution over candidate functions which fit the training data by assuming that the training outputs and the test outputs are drawn from a jointly distributed Multi-variate Gaussian. Neglecting measurement noise and assuming a zero mean prior for simplicity of explanation, we assume that the joint distribution of the training outputs, \\(y_{tr}\\) and the testing outputs, \\(y_{te}\\), is given by:</p> \\[ \\begin{bmatrix}     f(X_{tr}) \\\\     f(X_{te}) \\end{bmatrix} = \\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\begin{bmatrix}     K &amp;  K_* \\\\     K_*^{T} &amp; K_{**} \\end{bmatrix} \\right) \\] <p>for covariance matrices given by some measure of similarity (kernel function: \\(\\text{cov}\\)) \\(K=\\text{cov}(X_{tr}, X_{tr}), K_* = \\text{cov}(X_{tr}, X_{te}), K_{**} = \\text{cov}(X_{te}, X_{te})\\). After obtaining the data, \\(f(X_{tr}) = y_{tr}\\), we obtain the posterior distribution by conditioning this multivariate normal distribution:</p> \\[ y_{te} | y_{tr}, X_{tr}, X_{te} = \\mathcal{N}\\left(K_*K^{-1}y_{tr}, K_{**} - K_*K^{-1}K_*^T\\right) \\] <p>As an intuitive explanation of this formula, the mean of this normal distribution is the outputs of the training data weighted by how similar their corresponding inputs are to the test input, while the variance is entirely dependent on this similarity. Similarity is determined by the kernel function mentioned above, which uses the kernel trick to evaluate the similarity of the input vectors in a much higher dimensional space to evaluate a rich measure of similarity. One of the most commonly used kernel functions is the Radial Basis Function (RBF), which is computed for the length scale parameter, \\(l\\) as:</p> \\[ \\text{cov}(x_i, x_j) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{||x_i-x_j||^2_2}{2l^2}\\right). \\] <p>This kernel function is used for several desirable properties; namely its infinite dimensional feature space, exponentially decaying value of similarity, and positive definiteness. One limitation of this kernel function is that it implicitly assumes that the underlying function is smooth, and can give uninformative measures of similarity in high dimension, where the Euclidean distance between points tends to concentrate.</p> <p>This kernel is also strongly dependent on a reasonable choice of the length-scale parameter \\(l\\), which is often optimized by maximizing the log-likelihood of the training data, \\(y\\) with gradient based methods. The log-likelihood is written as:</p> \\[ \\log p(y_{tr} | X_{tr}, l) = -\\frac{1}{2}y_{tr}^T K^{-1}y_{tr} - \\frac{1}{2} \\log|K| - C_1 \\] <p>The first term of this measures the relation between the output values, and the relation expected by the covariance matrix structure. For example, if the covariance matrix predicts that y values should be highly correlated and they are not, the loss will be large. The second term is a measurement complexity term, which tries to drive the outputs of the kernel covariance lower. In the case of the RBF kernel, this corresponds to prioritizing smooth functions which still have a good data-fit. The constant, \\(C_1\\) is not important for the hyperparameter optimization. In practice, a measurement noise term, \\(\\sigma_n^2\\) is co-optimized with \\(l\\), but it is not included here for simplicity of explanation.</p> <p>Gaussian process regression with hyperparameter optimization can often fit low-dimensional smooth functions extremely well, but also has a time complexity of \\(O(n^3)\\) to fit data arising from the need to invert the \\(n \\times n\\) covariance matrix. This makes Gaussian process regression a natural choice for datasets with only a few number of points. After being trained, the time complexity to perform inference on \\(m\\) points is \\(O(n^2m)\\), meaning that Gaussian process regression can quickly become impractical for optimization routines or other use cases where the number of predictions required is extremely large. Typically, standard Gaussian process regression is impractical for datasets beyond a few thousand points.</p>"},{"location":"regressor_details/#black-box-matrix-multiplication-gaussian-process-regression","title":"Black-Box Matrix Multiplication Gaussian Process Regression","text":"<p>The key reason why Gaussian Process Regressions have a large training time complexity is the requirement to invert the matrix \\(K\\).

Critically, because of the deep learning architecture, it can avoid the large time complexity of Gaussian Processes such that it can scale to extremely large datasets. To train a neural network with dropout, at each iteration, each neuron in the hidden layers is assigned a binary variable with probability \\(p_{drop}\\) (typically near 0.1 or 0.2) of being 0. Each neuron assigned a value of 0 is dropped for that training pass, meaning that it simply returns a value of zero. The parameters are trained to minimize the mean squared error loss in this stochastic setting, where each iteration has a different combination of parameters. To perform inference, we perform \\(T\\) passes through the network with the same dropout methodology as during training to obtain \\(T\\) different samples of function values at each point. If desired, a distribution (typically Gaussian) can be fit to the outputs at each point. The theoretical results of (Gal) demonstrate that this approximates Bayesian Neural networks, where a distribution is placed over the weights within the neural network. However, Bayesian neural networks require a doubling of the parameters of a standard neural network, or one with dropout, and can also have undesirable optimization landscapes with poor convergence properties. The empirical results of (Gal) demonstrate comparable or better performance of Monte-Carlo dropout as compared to Bayesian Neural Networks on a variety of datasets, which is why Monte-Carlo dropout is implemented over Bayesian Neural Networks for this comparison.</p> <p>While Monte-Carlo dropout is an extremely efficient method of obtaining uncertainty distributions in addition to a mean prediction, the outputs are random, so they can be non-smooth, which can cause difficulties for optimization. Additionally, each training iteration optimizes different network parameters for a new random realization of the mean function, so the accuracy of this method may be less than that of traditional neural networks without dropout. Key benefits of Monte-Carlo dropout include that there are no required assumptions on the distribution of uncertainty, and that implementation requires minimum modification to standard neural networks.</p>"},{"location":"regressor_details/#deep-ensemble","title":"Deep Ensemble","text":"<p>Deep Ensembles, proposed by (Lakshminarayanan), are another relatively inexpensive approximation of Bayesian Neural Networks, which involve training several (i.e., an ensemble) of models and combining their outputs. Each regressor within the ensemble assumes that each point is an observation from a Gaussian distribution, and is trained to predict both the mean and standard deviation of an output given an input. During training, the negative log likelihood of the data given the predicted mean and standard deviation is minimized. During inference, the mean and variance from each regressor are combined by assuming that the overall distribution of uncertainty is also Gaussian with the mean and variance of the mixture. For \\(K\\) models, the mean and standard deviation are calculated as:</p> \\[ \\mu_*(x) = K^{-1}\\sum_{k=1}^K \\mu_{\\theta_k}(x), \\sigma_*^2(x)=K^{-1}\\sum_{k=1}^K(\\sigma_{\\theta_m}^2(x) + \\mu_{\\theta_m}^2(x)) - \\mu_*^2(x) \\] <p>When implementing this model, it is useful to let the outputs of each model predict the log of the standard deviation instead of the standard deviation itself for numerical stability and positive definiteness of the standard deviation. Additionally, one variant of this model is to randomly select a different subset of the training examples for every regressor to prioritize diversity in prediction and calibrate the uncertainty intervals towards difficulty of prediction. However, this was not necessary in order to produce well-calibrated intervals during the empirical studies by (Lakshminarayanan). In these studies, Deep Ensembles were shown to perform similarly or slightly worse as compared to Monte-Carlo dropout on a variety of public regression datasets on the basis of RMSE, but to significantly outperform Monte-Carlo dropout on the basis of negative log likelihood evaluated on the test set. This implies that deep ensembles output well calibrated uncertainty distributions, as the log-likelihood will penalize both poor fit and either over or under confident uncertainty intervals. This is explained in the paper by the fact that deep ensembles explicitly optimize for negative log likelihood during training as opposed to mean squared error.</p> <p>Deep ensembles are able to produce smooth uncertainty estimates in a well-calibrated sense, but assume that the uncertainty follows a known distribution. In many cases, a Gaussian distribution may be a good approximation to the distribution of uncertainty, unless prior knowledge about the problem indicates that a different distribution should be used. Additionally, Deep ensembles require fitting \\(K\\) estimators, although they can be fit in parallel to accomplish the same running time as standard neural networks. Ensemble predictors are generally desirable, as they can reduce the variance of the output function found through training, particularly for sparse datasets in high dimensions.

As a simple example, if we consider the drag of an airfoil near stall, very small changes in the angle of attack can result in large drops in lift. Therefore, slight modeling errors will result in a non-Gaussian distribution of error, where errors are more likely to be distributed below the prediction, to have a long-tailed distribution, and perhaps even demonstrate bi-modality. This can become especially important if the observations come from the physical world, as in a wind tunnel test, which may have measurement noise which does not demonstrate a Gaussian distribution. For this reason, a method of quantifying uncertainty which does not assume a distribution on uncertainty is included in these comparisons. A method which is rising in popularity in the machine learning community to accomplish distribution-free uncertainty estimation is conformal prediction.

However, this method has been shown empirically to provide good coverage (Nolte). Several methods exist to construct the difficulty function. One intuitive method is to train an ensemble of regressors, and to use the variance of the ensemble predictions at any point as an estimate of the prediction difficulty.
